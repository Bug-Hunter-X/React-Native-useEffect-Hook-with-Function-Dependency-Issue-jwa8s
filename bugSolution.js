The solution involves generating a unique key derived from the function's source code. This key changes whenever the function definition is modified, forcing React Native to recognize the change in the dependency and re-run the effect.

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const myFunction = React.useCallback(() => {
    // Some logic that changes over time
    console.log('My function ran');
  }, []);

  const functionKey = myFunction.toString();

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('useEffect ran');
    // Some side effect
  }, [functionKey]);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

Using `React.useCallback` ensures that `myFunction` is only created once, avoiding unnecessary re-renders and enhancing performance.  The function's string representation then serves as the reliable dependency key.
